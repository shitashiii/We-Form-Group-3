        	<h2>HISTORICAL OF SKETCH OF STSN</h2>
            <p><em>  The St. Theresas’s School of Novaliches was established by its founders, Gregorio, Sr. and Adoracion Roxas, as a modest response to the needs of the times. In their desire to give back to the community, they built a three-classroom learning center in January 1990 at the crossroad of Kingfisher and Skylark Streets, Novaliches, Quezon City.

          It initially started with a workforce of three teachers, three administrative personnel and thirty-eight students. Since then the school has grown in size and magnitude and in its quest for excellence in academics and other fields of endeavour. STSN was awarded full government recognition for pre-school on July 31, 1991; recognition for elementary level on April 6, 1993; and, recognition for the secondary level on June 16, 1997.

          As a Christian school, the STSN upholds the Church’s philosophy of education expressed in Declaration on Christian Education of Vatican II:

...a true education aims at the formation of the other human person in pursuit of his ultimate end and the good of the societies of which he is a member and whose obligation, as an adult, he will share.
          As a Filipino school, the STSN upholds the educational provisions of the Philippine Constitution:

...all educational institutions shall aim to inculcate love of country, teach the duties of citizenship, and develop moral character, personal discipline and scientific, technological and vocational efficiency.</em></p>

        <img class="image_wrapper" src="images/stsn_logo.png" alt="Image" />
        <p>   The STSN logo has the following main features: a lighted torch which symbolizes the enlightenment and guidance that STSN, as an academic institution, makes available to its students; an open book which stands for the Theresian’s continuous quest for knowledge and wisdom; the laurel leaves speak of the Theresian’s pursuit of excellence in academics and other fields of endeavor; and the light rays emanating from the torch stand for the Theresian spirit reaching out to serve God through service to fellowmen.</p>
